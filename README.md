# PoSharp

*A .Net Core library for working with the RapidAPI Poshmark API.*

## About

I use Poshmark quite a bit and there are some weird ways that it works. I wanted a programmatic way to handle some of the things I find myself checking without relying on the cruft of the app or the website. This led me to start looking for some sort of web API that I could hit to pull some information, which I found on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/apimaker/api/poshmark). 

## Usage

It currently doesn't have anything validated or tested. So if you're reading this...you might be on your own. 

## Prerequisites

* [RapidAPI Subscription and Key](https://rapidapi.com/apimaker/api/poshmark)
